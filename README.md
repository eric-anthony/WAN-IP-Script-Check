# WAN-IP-Script-Check

This script is designed to monitor for changes in WAN IP address in the SolarWinds MSP RMM dashboard.

By default the $Debug variable is set to $TRUE but to keep your log file smaller you can set it to $FALSE.

You can also modify the path or filename of the logfile itself.

If the logfile is not found in the location specified, the script will automatically create one.
